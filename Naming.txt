SLGen:
- The most basic element that takes in configuration parameters, the basic environment (Led amount, etc.) and implements the code generation based on a json-file.

EnvConfig:
- The basic configuration that is not slgen-specific and get's passed to everything. This includes things like the amount of leds or later on maybe a specific code-generation guidline
